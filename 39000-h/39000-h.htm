<h2 id="Preface">PREFACE</h2>

<p id="initial"><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus006s.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">W</span>HAT</b> is genius? Is it not both masculine and feminine? Are not some of
its qualities instinct with manhood, while others delight us with the
most winning graces of a perfect womanhood? Does not genius make its
appeal as a single creative agent with a two-fold sex?</p>

<p>But if genius has its Mirandas and its Regans no less than its
infinite types of men, ranging from Prospero and Ferdinand to Caliban
and Trinculo, its union of the sexes does not remain always at peace
within the sphere of art. Sometimes, in the genius of men, the female
characteristics gain mastery over the male qualities; at other times
the male attributes of woman's genius win empire and precedence over
the female; and whenever these things happen, the works produced in
art soon recede from the world's sympathies, losing all their first
freshness. They may guide us, perhaps, as finger-posts in history,
pointing the way to some movement of interest; but their first
popularity as art is never renewed. Style is the man in the genius of
men, style is the woman in the genius of the fair. No male artist,
however gifted he may be, will ever be able to experience all the
emotional life to which women are subject; and no woman of abilities,
how much soever she may try, will be able to borrow from men anything
so invaluable to art as her own intuition and the prescient tenderness
and grace of her nursery-nature. Thus, then, the bisexuality of genius
has limits in art, and those limits should be determined by a worker's
sex.</p>

<p>As examples in art of complete womanliness, mention may be made of two
exquisite portraits by Madame Le Brun, in which, whilst representing
her little daughter and herself, the painter discloses the inner
essence and the life of maternal love, and discloses them with a
caressing playfulness of passion unattainable by men, and sometimes
unappreciated by men. Here, indeed, we have the poetry of universal
motherhood, common to the household hearts of good women the wide
world over. Such pictures may not be the highest form of painting, but
highest they are in their own realm of human emotion; and they recall
to one's memory that truth in which Napoleon the Great ranked the
gentler sex as the most potent of all creative artists. "The future
destiny of children," said he, "is always the work of mothers."</p>

<p>But some persons may answer: "Yes, but the achievements of women
painters have been second-rate. Where is there a woman artist equal to
any man among the greatest masters?" Persons who do not think are
constantly asking that question. The greatest geniuses were all
hustled and moulded into shape by the greatest epochs of ambition in
the lives of nations, just as the mountains of Switzerland were thrown
up to their towering heights by tremendous forces underground; and, as
the Alps do not repeat themselves, here and there, for the pleasure of
tourists, so the greatest geniuses do not reappear for the pleasure of
critics or of theorists. And this is not all. Why compare the
differing genius of women and men? There is room in the garden of art
for flowers of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> kind and for butterflies and birds of every
species; and why should anyone complain because a daisy is not a rose,
or because nightingales and thrushes, despite their family
resemblance, have voices of their own, dissimilar in compass and in
quality?</p>

<p>The present book, then, is a history of woman's garden in the art of
painting, and its three hundred pictures show what she has grown in
her garden during the last four centuries and a half. The Editor has
tried to free his mind of every bias, so that this book, within the
limits of 332 pages, might be as varied as the subject. The choice of
pictures has not been easy, and a few disappointments have attended
the many communications with the owners of copyrights; but only two
invited artists have declined to contribute. It is not often that so
much willing and generous help has come to an Editor from so many
countries; and it is with gratitude that I acknowledge the assistance
received from the contributors of to-day. Seven pictures are
reproduced in colour-facsimile, thanks to the courtesy of the
following artists and collectors: Mrs. Allingham, Miss Ann Macbeth,
Mr. James Orrock, R.I., Mr. W A. Cadbury, Mr. Charles Cheston, Mr.
Klackner, and Mr. Charles Dowdeswell.</p>

<p>The Dedication Page, the Initials Letters, the End Papers, are all
designs by Miss Ethel Larcombe, while the <a href="#TitlePage">Title Page</a>

Bodenheim, used as tail-pieces, are published by permission of S. L.
van Loo&yuml;, Amsterdam.</p>

<p>This volume being the first illustrated history of the Women Painters
of the World, Her Majesty Queen Alexandra has honoured it by
graciously accepting the Dedication; and in this encouraging act is
revealed the untiring interest and solicitude with which Her Majesty
has ever followed the progress of women's work.</p>

<p class="dropcap red">Owing to various reasons, the work of several well-known painters
could not be obtained until this book had passed through the press,
and a supplement of pictures has therefore been placed between page
<a href="#Page_324">324</a> and page <a href="#Page_325">325</a>. It includes work by Lady Alma-Tadema, Mrs. Seymour
Lucas, Mrs. Marrable, Miss Maud Earl, Miss Julia B. Folkard, Miss
Maude Goodman, Miss Flora M. Reid, Miss Blanche Jenkins, and Madame
Ars&egrave;ne Darmesteter.</p>

<p class="red">It is hoped that the Women Painters of To-day may be studied again in
a second volume. In the present book, dealing with 450 years of work,
the living painters could not be fully represented, for there are
thousands of ladies who now win a place in the art exhibitions of
Europe and America.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_I">Women Painters in Italy since the Fifteenth Century</h2>

<p class="h3">By Walter Shaw Sparrow</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus011s.jpg" width="102" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">O</span>LDER</b> than the authenticated history of Greek art is a tradition that
connects a girl's name with the discovery of a great craft, the craft
of modelling portraits in relief. Kora, known as the virgin of
Corinth, and daughter of a potter named Butades, sat one evening with
her betrothed in her father's house; a torch burned, a fire of wood
bickered in a brasier, throwing on the wall in shadow a clear
silhouette of the young man's profile; and Kora, moved by a sudden
impulse, took from the hearth a charred piece of wood and outlined the
shadow. When the girl's father, Butades, saw the sketch which she had
made, he filled in the outline with his potters' clay, forming the
first medallion.</p>

<p>It is a pretty, chivalrous tradition, and it recalls to one's memory
the fact that the ancient Greeks had really some women artists of
note, like Aristarete, daughter and pupil of Nearchus, celebrated for
her picture of Aesculapius; or like Anaxandra (about B.C. 228),
daughter of the painter Nealces, or like Helena, who painted the
battle of Issus, about B.C. 333.</p>

<p>Passing from Greece to ancient Rome, we find only one woman painter,
Lala by name, and she was a Greek by birth and education. Lala lived
and laboured in the first century before the birth of Christ. She went
to Rome during the last days of the republic, and won for herself a
great reputation by her miniature portraits of ladies.</p>

<p>As the early Christians turned away from all luxury and adornment, the
influence of Christ's life was very slow in gaining its benign
ascendency in the arts; but among the civilisations which were founded
on the ruins of Rome's decline and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> fall, there were some women who
still deserve to be remembered for their patronage of art.
Amalasontha, daughter of Theodoric the Great, Theodelinda, Queen of
the Lombards, Hroswitha, in her convent at Gandershein, and Ava, the
first German poetess, these ladies, and many others, made colonising
names, names that visited distant lands and gave ambition to other
women.</p>

<p>Briefly, the Renaissance was heralded by a long, troubled dawn; but it
came at last, and its effects on the destinies of women were immediate
and far-reaching. In Italy, one by one, the Universities were opened
to the fair, that of Bologna leading the way in the 13th century, when
Betisia Gozzadini studied there with success, dressed as a boy, like
Plato's pupil, Axiothea. And a line of girl graduates connects Betisia
Gozzadini with the women lecturers who became so famous at Bologna in
the 18th century: Anna Manzolini, Laura Bassi, Clotilde Tambroni,
Maria Agnesi, and Maria Dalle-Donne.</p>

<p>It is not easy to explain why the Italian towns and universities gave
so much encouragement to the higher aspirations of girls. In poetry,
in art, in learning, that encouragement was equally remarkable, and I
am tempted to assign its origin to the martial temper of the Middle
Ages, which drew many young men from the universities to take part in
the exercises of the tilt-yard or in the perils of the battlefield,
leaving the fields of learning in need of zealous labourers. Women, on
the other hand, exposed their hearts, but not their lives, to the
hazards of duels, tournaments and wars; they lived longer than men, as
a rule, and hence it was worth while to encourage publicly those gifts
of the female mind and spirit which had long been cultivated privately
for the benefit of peaceful nunneries.</p>

<p>Still, whatever the origin of it may have been, the pride taken by the
Italians in their gifted women is among the most important facts in
the history of their Renaissance. But for that pride, the scores of
ladies who became noted in the arts would have remained unknown in
their homes, and the story of those times would lack in its social
life a counterpart of that radiant chivalry that cast so much
tenderness and sanctity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> about the Motherhood of Mary and the Infancy
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>As this chapter is nothing more than a brief introduction to the study
of a very important subject, I can say only a few words about the
different groups of painters into which the women artists of Italy are
divided, beginning with the early nuns, whose art was not so much a
craft as a confession of faith.</p>

<p>Caterina Vigri was the earliest of these nuns, and the picture by
which she is represented on page <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, "St. Ursula and her Maidens," was
painted in the year 1456. Not only is it typical of the young
Bolognese school, but, despite the primitiveness of the drawing, it
has two qualities in which the swift temperaments of women, so
truth-telling in their emotions, commonly manifest themselves in art:
the first is a certain naturalness of gesture and of pose; the second
is an evident wish to impart life and liveliness to the faces, even
although that liveliness and life may not accord with the subject in
its higher spiritual significance. It is this natural wish of women to
be homely and attractive that so frequently brings their art nearer to
the people's sympathies than the work done by men; and if we study the
four illustrations on pages <a href="#Page_34">34</a> and <a href="#Page_35">35</a>, representing pictures by the
Sienese nuns of Santa Marta, we shall see how motherly in tenderness
was the feminine ideal of Christ's infancy. I can gain no information
about Barbara Ragnoni and the two other sister nuns, whose names have
passed into Time's limbo of forgotten things, and whom I have ventured
to describe as Sister A. and Sister B. They were true artists, each
one having a sweet graciousness of her own, playful, yet devout and
reverent, devotional but not austere. In these pictures the maternal
instincts are at play; the painters are so happy in their subject that
their whole womanhood responds to it, making it a holy experience of
their own glad hearts. There is much to admire also in the way in
which the figures are grouped and co-ordinated; and how charming is
that glympse of country painted by Barbara Ragnoni in her "Adoration
of the Shepherds."</p>

<p>These were not the only gifted and gracious nuns in the early history
of Italian art. There was Plautilla Nelli,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> who formed her style on
that of Fra Bartolommeo; she became prioress of a convent in Florence,
the convent of St. Catherine, and died in 1588, aged sixty-five.
Barbara Longhi of Ravenna, another painter of the same period, was not
a nun, but I mention her now in order that attention may be drawn to a
painter having a genuine sympathy and style (see page <a href="#Page_41">41</a>).</p>

<p>We pass on to a little bevy of emigrants, women painters who visited
foreign courts where they met with great successes. Sophonisba
Anguisciola, born of a noble family in Cremona, was enriched by Philip
II. of Spain; Artemesia Gentileschi came to London with her father and
found a patron in Charles I.; Maria La Caffa (17th century), a flower
painter, came upon her M&aelig;cenas in the Court of Tyrol; it was in German
Courts that Isabella del Pozzo (17th century), like Felicita Sartori
(18th century), plucked bay leaves and laurels; and Violanta Beatrice
Siries, after making for herself a name in Paris, returned home to
Florence and painted many famous persons of the 18th century. Then we
have Rosalba Carriera, whose career ended in blindness and loss of
reason, and whose whole life is a touching story. As a child she made
Point of Venice lace; at the age of fourteen or fifteen she painted
snuff boxes with flowers and pretty faces; then miniatures of
well-known persons kept her brushes busy; but this minute art tried
her eyes so seriously that Rosalba adopted pastels instead, and soon
became the most famous pastellist of her period. She journeyed pretty
well all over the Continent, winning an extraordinary success wherever
she went, as well as a place in all the Academies of note, from the
Clementina at Bologna to the Royal Academy at Paris. Rosalba Carriera
arrived in Paris in April 1720; she kept a diary of her experiences,
and students of French history should read it in the edition annotated
by Alfred Sensier. But here we are concerned with the art alone of
Rosalba Carriera, an art rich in colour, swift and nervous in drawing,
full of character, and modelled always with vigour and with ease.</p>

<p>Returning now to an earlier traveller, Sophonisba Anguisciola, we meet
with another portraitist of real merit, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
self-contained than
Rosalba, less impetuous, but fresh, witty, sincere and charming. It is
probable that she was born in 1533. After studying for some time at
Cremona, under Bernardino Campi, Sophonisba Anguisciola began to make
fun of the little girls of the period. Vasari set the greatest store
by one of these satirical sketches, representing a boy with a lobster
clawed to his finger, and a small girl laughing at his nimbleness. The
subject of another skit was an old woman studying the Alphabet, much
to the amusement of a baby girl.</p>

COLLECTION.<br />VASARI SAW THIS PICTURE AND SAID THAT "THE FIGURES WANTED
ONLY VOICE TO BE ALIVE."<br />
Sophonisba Anguisciola or Angussola, Painter<br />
1533(?)-1626</p>

<p>That Sophonisba Anguisciola was very young when she first attracted
notice from the great, is proved by the fact that she sent a likeness
of herself&mdash;a likeness now at Vienna&mdash;to Pope Julius III., who died in
1555. It was in her twenty-seventh year that she made her way, with
ten attendants, to the Spanish Court, there to paint a history in
admired portraits of the great age of the <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>: a history
which <i>tempus edax</i> has devoured, leaving us only those works which
Sophonisba turned out in her native country, far away from the dark
tragedies of the Escorial. Philip the Second married his proteg&eacute;e to a
wealthy Sicilian noble, Don Fabrizio de Mon&ccedil;ada, giving her a huge
dowry of 12,000 ducats, a pension of 1,400 scudi, and a dress loaded
with pearls, besides other presents.</p>

<p>Sophonisba retired with her husband to Palermo, where she soon became
a widow. Then Philip and his Queen wished her to return to Madrid; but
the artist pleaded an excuse, the excuse of homesickness, and set sail
for Italy. The captain of the galley of war, Orazio Lomellini, was a
handsome man of good family, a native of Genoa; his gallantry had
suffered a sea-change, was altogether breezy, sailor-like, delightful;
and Sophonisba not only fell in love with him, she took him at a
leap-year advantage, and soon changed her "weeds" for a bridal dress.</p>

<p>When Van Dyck met her at Genoa (1622), and painted several members of
her husband's family, Sophonisba was upwards of eighty-seven years
old, and quite blind; but the blithe old lady still went on painting
so well in her familiar conversations that Van Dyck said he had learnt
more from her talk than from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> his other teachers. Had Steele an
inkling of this magnificent compliment when he said that to love the
Lady Elizabeth Hastings was a liberal education? Addison may have
heard of it in Italy, and in turning over his thoughts before Master
Richard, may have dropped it generously. But, however this may be,
Stirling gives too much point to Van Dyck's words; for he says boldly,
in <i>The Annals of the Artists of Spain</i>, that my painter's portraits
are little inferior to those by Titian. "Of this evidence is
afforded," says he, "by that beautiful portrait of her, which is now
no mean gem of the galleries and libraries of Althorp."</p>

<p>Perhaps one may defy critics to name a single latter-day "realist"
among the fair who has attained to Artemisia Gentileschi's masterful
and singular ruthlessness, as in the several pictures of Judith that
she painted. One of these pictures will be found on page
<a href="#Page_45">45</a>. It is the
least relentless of the series, but it shows clearly enough the grip
of Artemisia's hand in tragedy. Curiously, the suave Guido was
Artemisia's first teacher, but she learnt more from Domenichino, and
more still from the years she passed at Naples, then known as "the
sink of all iniquity." But Artemisia Gentileschi is sometimes kind in
her work, and gentle; she does not always remind us of that Artemisia
who fought so well at Salamis, causing Xerxes to cry: "Behold! the men
behave like women, and the women like men!" In her excellent
portraits, and in pictures like the "Mary Magdalene," on page <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, she
blends some graciousness of thought with vigour and variety of
technique.</p>

<p>Lavinia Fontana and Elisabetta Sirani were the ablest women painters
whose travels did not extend beyond Italy. The first was a member of
the old Roman Academy, and Pope Gregory XIII. made her his portraitist
in ordinary. She was born of good family in Bologna, anno 1552. It was
her father that shaped the laggard talents of Lodovico Carracci, and
from him came the girl's first lessons in drawing. Lavinia spent most
of her life in Rome, where, for close on two generations, she held
society by the austere truth of her portraiture. Ladies of high rank
vied with one another to become her sitters, and a long red line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> of
cardinals sat to her. Pope Paul the Fifth was among Lavinia's models;
very high prices were paid readily for her work, and not a few
noblemen wished to marry her; but the artist remained true to the
young Count of Imola, Giovanni Paolo Zappi, a good, kind,
simple-hearted fellow, an aristocratic Barnaby Rudge. Him she married,
and it was her ill-hap to see his simplicity repeat itself in one of
their two sons, a lad who kept the Pope's antechamber merry.</p>

<p>My artist's style, though modelled to some extent on that of the
Carracci, has a distinction of its own. Even the arid K&uuml;gler gives
Lavinia his rare good word, reckoning her a better artist than her
father, and adding: "Her work is clever and bold, and in portraiture,
especially, she has left good things."</p>

<p>Does Elisabetta Sirani take precedence of Lady Waterford? Perhaps they
may be regarded as two equal queens in the world of woman's art, each
with a beautiful artistic intellect. Even at the age of nineteen, as
old Bartsch admits, Elisabetta etched exquisite plates; and, before
she was twenty-three, her paintings were sought after by all the
patron-critics of her country. Yet her male rivals hinted that she was
dishonest, that she did not paint her own pictures, but had "ghosts"
to win fame and fortune for her&mdash;especially her father, a poor
"ghost," afflicted with inherited gout. Elisabetta happily soon turned
the sneer against her rivals. This she did by working before an
audience of distinguished persons, like Cosimo, Crown Prince of
Tuscany, who on May 13th, 1664, stood by whilst she painted a likeness
of his uncle, the Prince Leopold.</p>

<p>Malvasia gives in his spirited monograph a list of 150 pictures by
Elisabetta Sirani; and Lanzi deemed it marvellous that one who died so
young should yet have brought to completion so many hopeful efforts of
real genius. The brilliant girl painted with great rapidity. One of
her finest achievements&mdash;the "Baptism of Christ"&mdash;is a very large
picture, and the story of its conception is noteworthy. Elisabetta was
little more than twenty at the time, and the clergy who had been sent
to order the work for the Church of the Certosini at Bologna, looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on whilst she, radiant with inspiration, made her first impulsive
sketch in pen-and-ink. The beholders were enchanted, and the huge
picture, differing little in essentials from the sketch, was painted
almost as rapidly as Dumas repeopled the distant past. In brief,
Elisabetta Sirani, like all women of genius, worked under an intuitive
rather than technical guidance; and in her art, consequently, as in
Lady Waterford's, we find those blemishes and beauties which belong to
a native habit of spontaneous workmanship.</p>

<p>As to her private life, it is full of heroic virtues. The noble girl
kept the whole family: her mother, who was stricken with paralysis;
her father, who suffered intolerably from the gout; and her two
sisters, whom she educated with a large class of girl art-students.
Then Cupid came, saw, and was overcome, and Elisabetta, by way of
celebrating this unkind victory, painted the little god in the act of
crowning his victor. But the pity of it all was this: the girl had so
many taut strings to her bow that the frail bow could not but break.
Elisabetta's health gave way, a painful disease of the stomach
assailed her; and yet to the last day but one of her short life&mdash;i.e.,
August 27th, 1665&mdash;she remained true to her colours, and was one of
art's truest soldiers. "The best way not to feel pain is not to think
of it," said she, and then went slowly back to her studio.</p>

<p>The present book contains adequate examples of the work of Elisabetta
Sirani, of Lavinia Fontana Zappi, of Artemisia Gentileschi, of
Sophonisba Anguisciola, of Rosalba Carriera; and there is a good
drawing by Diana Ghisi, the painter-engraver, an excellent copy by
Maria Tibaldi Subleyras, and two characteristic pictures by Agnese
Dolci, sister of Carlo Dolci and his equal in talent. These painters
and the early nuns, Caterina Vigri and the three sisters of Santa
Marta, Siena, are enough to represent the old Italian schools; while
three characteristic pictures by Elisa Koch, Juana Romani, and Rosina
Gutti, unite the present with the far-distant past, a past separated
from the present day by four hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus034s.jpg" width="105" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">E</span>VERYBODY</b> knows that it has fallen to England's lot to gem the remote
seas with shining repetitions of herself. But everybody does not
remember that she has done this quite at haphazard, just as the winds
carry seeds from a garden to a waste ground. In herself, with fitful
moments of purposeful energy, England has been self-critical and
self-distrustful, disinclined to value her own doings or to take
precautions when in the midst of dangers. But for the individual
enterprise of her children, which she has often disowned and punished,
her colonies would have been the Isle of Man and the Isle of Wight.
And it is singular to note also that the history of England's genius
in art has followed the traditional character of her devious
makeshifts in commerce and in war. Despite all inherent weaknesses,
she has achieved at random a recognised greatness in art, and is so
surprised at it that she hesitates always to encourage the gifts of
her own craftsmen, preferring rather to have confidence in the work
which she can buy from men of genius in other countries. From the time
of Henry VIII. to the coming of the school of Reynolds, she allowed
her own painters to starve in order that she might employ strangers;
and to-day, as in the past, she butterflies from foreign school to
foreign school and treats her own native arts to side-glances and
half-friendly nods.</p>

<p>Now, as this has ever been England's disposition, it is not surprising
to find that Englishwomen, as well as Englishmen, long hesitated to
follow the arts professionally. At a time when Italy and France had
scores of women painters, England had scarcely one. Perhaps the
earliest of any note, if we except Susannah Penelope Gibson, a
miniature painter, was Mrs. Mary Beale, daughter of a Suffolk
clergyman named Cradock. She lived between the years 1632 and 1697.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
After modelling her style on that of Lely, she worked with great
courage, showing much real talent, particularly in quiet portraiture.
She painted broadly and well, drew with force and discrimination, and
although she told the truth plainly at a time when other painters
flattered and fawned, she yet achieved success, and was encouraged by
the highest in the land, from King Charles the Second to Archbishop
Tillotson. Time has robbed her colour of its first freshness, but the
character remains, and the portraits on page <a href="#Page_81">81</a> represent Mary Beale
in a characteristic manner.</p>

<p>The next English women painters in order of merit were Lady Diana
Beauclerk, an amateur with much untutored talent, and Catharine Read,
a distinguished professional artist of the Reynolds period. That she
was appreciated in her day is proved by the fact that her portraits
were engraved, side by side with those of Reynolds and Gainsborough.
To-day she is forgotten, and very little can be learnt about her life
or about the present owners of her pictures. Catharine Read lived near
St. James's and sent frequently to the exhibitions. In 1770 she went
to the East Indies, but in a few years returned to London, where she
died in or about the year 1786.</p>

<p>Angelica Kauffman, R.A., though born at Coire, the capital of the
Grisons, belongs to the British school, and holds in the early history
of that school a position similar to that which has been assigned in
France to Madame Vig&eacute;e Le Brun. The art of the two ladies differs
widely to be sure, that of Angelica Kauffman having less mirth, less
wit, less sprightliness and homeful sincerity; it is quite artificial
in spirit, with a strong bias towards the sentimental; but it has for
all that considerable charm and ability, qualities, let us remember,
that won the admiration of Reynolds and of Goethe. Turner, also,
possessed two of her drawings, as I am told by his descendant, Mr
Charles Mallord W. Turner. But in recent times Angelica Kauffman has
been remembered for the romance of her personal life and treated with
cool contempt in all that appertains to her work. Critics have
searched in her pictures for manly qualities, and finding there the
temperament of a sentimental woman, their judgment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> has failed them.
The very men who would be astonished beyond measure if a prima donna
sang to them in a voice like the leading tenor's, do not hesitate to
complain when the voice in a woman's painting is one filled with
womanhood.</p>

<p>In England, at the close of the 18th century, quite a number of ladies
came to the front in art, like Caroline Watson, the admirable stipple
engraver (page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>), or like Catherine Maria Fanshawe, a painter-etcher
who could put a body into a peasant's smock and could show in a rustic
figure the mingled influences of Morland and Gainsborough, while
keeping a tender sympathy of her own (page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>). Amelia Hotham, too, in
the native art of water-colour, attained to a broad and vigorous style
in landscape, while taking far too many hints from the scenic pomp
that Francis Nicholson made popular in outdoor scenes (page <a href="#Page_88">88</a>).
Nevertheless, Amelia Hotham's work has interest in the history of
British water-colour, like that of three other ladies who followed
her, the Viscountess Templetown (page <a href="#Page_94">94</a>), Matilda Heming and Mrs.
John Herford, the grandmother of Mrs. Allingham. Matilda Heming's
picture on page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>, "Backwater, Weymouth, Dorset," is weak in the
drawing of the hills, but the rest of the design is quite admirable,
the boats particularly being very well drawn. We see, then, that
during the last decades of the 18th century, and at the beginning of
the nineteenth, a little band of Englishwomen studied landscape
painting seriously; and this fact is worth remembering, as women have
seldom been drawn in art to nature in the woods and fields. The
gentler sex, as a rule, has not appreciated landscapes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they have shown in art a great love for the beauty
of flowers, the colour and the forms of insects, and the
"other-naturalness" of many kinds of animals. Maria Sibylla Merian,
Rachel Ruysch, Rosa Bonheur, Fidelia Bridges, Mrs. Coleman Angell,
Madame Ronner, Mlle. E. Hilda, Miss Lucy Kemp-Welch&mdash;these ladies will
not be forgotten, let us hope, as long as there are students who take
delight in plants, flowers, birds and animals.</p>

<p>Among the flower and fruit painters in England, during the 18th
century and the first few decades of the nineteenth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> conspicuous
places must be assigned to Mary Moser, R.A., Mrs. Margaret Meen, and
Anne Frances Byrne, illustrations of whose pictures will be found on
page <a href="#Page_94">94</a>; and the reader will do well to compare this early work with
that of Mrs. Coleman Angell, the female counterpart of William Hunt
(page <a href="#Page_102">102</a>).</p>

<p>Whilst these flower-painters were busy, another small group of ladies
won considerable popularity by their little figure-subjects, such as
the Countess Spencer's drawing on page <a href="#Page_90">90</a>, or again, like the fanciful
miniatures by Mrs. Mee or the sentimental portraits by Mrs. J.
Robertson, types of which are given on page <a href="#Page_93">93</a>. Miss Curran's portrait
of Shelley is a valuable portrait-sketch historically (page <a href="#Page_90">90</a>), and
it has something of the charm that distinguishes the able portraits
drawn to-day by the Marchioness of Granby.</p>

<p>What can be said about Mrs. Margaret Carpenter? Is she not to be
placed among those quiet, unpretentious portrait-painters whose
thoughts are so wrapped up in their determination to be true that they
never think of striving after exhibition-room effects? Margaret
Carpenter gives us the character of her sitters, and not technical
displays of her own cleverness. Born at Salisbury, in 1793, the
daughter of Captain Geddes, this able painter came to London in 1814,
and married, in 1817, William Carpenter, who for many years was Keeper
of the Print Room in the British Museum. She exhibited often at the
Royal Academy until 1864, and made a great reputation by her
portraits. She died in 1872, leaving a son, William Carpenter
(1819-1899), to continue the art tradition which she had herself
carried on in her family.</p>

<p>Some may think that Margaret Carpenter began the modern history of
women painters in England; others may grant that distinction to the
intuitive and radiant work of Lady Waterford, that most gifted of all
amateurs. It seems truer to say that Margaret Carpenter is best
described as a connecting-link between the old and the new, and that
Lady Waterford is not only so faithful to herself but so spontaneous,
that her good gifts belong to no particular school or period. They
certainly owed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> much to the colour of the Venetian School, far more
to that old source of inspiration than to any influence of the 19th
century. But the main characteristics of Lady Waterford's appeal come
to us from the painter's own heart and beautiful &aelig;sthetic intellect.
The ease with which she composed, and the charming animation of all
her designs, these were natural qualities uninfluenced by any
teaching; and they won the ardent admiration of the late Mr. G. F.
Watts. It is the spirit alone of Lady Waterford's art that we should
admire; we must not look closely at the drawing, for Lady Waterford
neither tried nor wished to perfect her faulty technical equipment.
Most of her art-work was done after a day spent in other charities. It
was Lady Waterford's joy to dole out alms herself, and it never
occurred to her that she might do such good actions by proxy, just as
Queen Charlotte picked up five old books in the booths of Holywell
Street. The truth is that Lady Waterford valued practicalness more
than imagination, as do the great majority of women; she longed to
<i>see</i> the good she did, and she could not realise to herself that art
has a permanent ethical influence. Closing her eyes to this truth,
Lady Waterford wrote as follows to one of her friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I could never attain to even one work that I see in my mind's
eye, and if I could it would be less than those of the great men
of old, <i>whose greatest works have not quelled evil or taught
good</i>.... I could not live for art&mdash;it would not be what I am
put in the world to do. I do not despise art, but I should feel
that it was not given for that. Two homes have been given me,
and it is to try to do what I can in them that they are given
for brief life."</p>

<p>Is not that pathetic? Is it not the very music of a woman's
rationalism? What has "quelled evil?" But if our hearts and
minds rise to an entire sympathy with Lady Waterford's sketches,
we shall certainly feel that a noble spirit in art does indeed
"teach good," is a spiritual almsgiving for all time, a charity
that goes on ministering, through long generations, to that
which is best in human nature.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus037s.jpg" width="105" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">I</span>T</b> is the privilege of man, in his youth, to ignore his limitations.
For this ignorance he pays in failure the price of a possible success.
In his wiser middle age he does not repent, he finds that it is only
by some sort of an attack on his limitations that apparent results are
attained, and he learns to take on faith the difference there is in
fact between the attainment and the attempt. The experience of a woman
is, I take it, very similar. It follows in no way that, because her
limitations are different from, and in a physical sense greater than,
man's, the brutal laws which go to produce results are in her case
different. She is marching along the same road, and though she may
have other stopping places by the way and perhaps may take up more
modest quarters in the end, it is a journey and an arrival, an effort
and a result, and the things seen by the wayside become of
significance to her as the painted banners under which she seeks her
way.</p>

<p>Englishwomen do not seem to have done much in painting before the
generation or two that are just past. Public opinion was against them.
The early Victorian conditions under which a woman like Charlotte
Bront&euml; produced her great results in another art are more or less
familiar to all, and in the matter of painting the voice of prejudice
has had still more to say. By these days it has croaked itself into
the feeble hoarseness of a respectable and decent old age, and we can
already look back to a succession of women painters who seem to have
been conscious at first of their leading-strings, but who have shown a
development more than corresponding to that of the conditions under
which they worked. Kate Greenaway, who died only a few years ago, was
no doubt a good example of the charming results to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> obtained in
leading-strings. To compare her with an artist who works in a similar
field to-day is to note an advance, not only of a generation, but of
the changing educational conditions within the generation. It is a far
cry from Kate Greenaway to Miss Alice Woodward, for instance, and it
is difficult to imagine that another age will say anything more, or
less, of Miss Woodward than that she was a most distinguished artist.
The leading-strings are gone.</p>

<p>It will always be a special field for women, the production of work in
the first place for children, and it is unnecessary to spend time in
emphasising or over-emphasising its importance. Art itself reckons
little with motives and much with results. In a more general view it
would, perhaps, be better to start this small article with some notice
of the women painters of the seventeenth, eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. There is Mrs. Mary Beale, who was a child when
Cromwell was Lord Protector, and who later on painted a most excellent
portrait of Charles II. There is some work of hers in the National
Portrait Gallery, London, work of the quiet, genuine kind, and better
than most of the painting that came for some time afterwards. Then
there is Angelica Kauffman, R.A., who provides us with perhaps the
only well-known name of the early periods, and there are some
portrait-painters of interest, like Miss Catharine Read, of Reynolds'
time, or like Mrs. Anne Mee, of the early part of last century. But it
must be confessed that it would be a sorry list for a couple of
centuries if it were a fact that women had had the same opportunities
and no greater disabilities than the men of the period. It is not
indeed until we reach such painters as Margaret Carpenter, the
portrait painter, Mrs. Matilda Heming, the landscapist, and Lady
Waterford, that more than charming amateur who might have done so
much, that we begin to feel we have a reasonable genesis of the worker
of to-day. These painters show to us now rather the influences of
their time or the limitations of their opportunities, than
personalities which are outside such considerations, but they
nevertheless provide us with evidence of a very genuine and lively
activity.</p>

<p>The work of Mrs. Heming is interesting in a rather more special way.
It is distinctly rare to find the ordinary landscapist of her time
working with an eye to truth rather than to the making of a so-called
composition of the period, rare enough in fact to place her quite
above the ordinary.</p>

<p>It is at first sight a curious thing that more women painters have not
even in these days been attracted by pure landscape. It is strange in
the sense that they have among them such painters as Lady Butler and
Miss Lucy Kemp-Welch. But no branch of art is more that of the
specialists than landscape. It developed later in history than any
other, and it calls to those who would tire of the didactic in human
thought and who might find in the study of any obviously human affair
something to remind them of a phase of experience they would, in
paint, avoid. No doubt the Empress Frederick turned to landscape as an
occupation of relief from the pressing human affairs in which her life
was involved, and it is just in such a way that the natural
landscapist turns from the human side of life to the more abstract
emotions he finds in the garden of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>Women, I believe, are more held by the personal than the abstract.
Mrs. Allingham may be one of the exceptions. In any case Mrs.
Allingham claims quite a special place for herself in any
sketch-survey of the work of English women painters. Few women have
shown a more definitely English sympathy in landscape than she has.
Her method is simple, obvious and plain for all to see. For that
reason it would fail to appeal in any way to the Eclectics, or to
those among them, at any rate, who, in the words of a subtle Eclectic,
confound the natural with the commonplace. A distinctly home-bred
feeling, such as Mrs. Allingham has among women, or, in the grand
manner, Fred Walker among men, is however a very rare thing and is
becoming rarer. How far it may, in individual cases, change to other
things may be seen in some of the more modern painters, in the
remarkably strong work of Miss Margaret Cameron, Miss Biddie
Macdonald, Miss Alice Fanner, and Miss Beatrice How. This latter
painter has not merely been affected in matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> of technique, but
gives us, most delightfully, the very sentiment of the country people
she paints. It is quite a little miracle of transplanted adaptability.</p>

<p>It has been said that every good woman has in her marching outfit a
supply of adaptability which, in sum total, accounts for most of the
happiness enjoyed by the human race at large. If so, it may be added
that in its superior manifestations the affair is sub-conscious,
artistic, most natural and not at all one of the commonplaces of life.
It perhaps explains, or rather is illustrated by, the number of
painters in the very first rank among women who have shown in their
work the influence of some near relative. In any case, Lady
Alma-Tadema for one has produced work so extraordinarily good in
itself that it is easy to believe the similarity of her technique to
that of Sir Laurence Alma-Tadema to be merely one of the happy chances
of her life. A very similar thought arises in connection with the work
of the late Miss Margaret Dicksee. It is easy to influence technique,
but first causes are not set in action by human hands. If one who did
not know her may say so, there is written on the canvases that Miss
Dicksee has left behind the evidence of a most lovable nature.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanhope Forbes, Miss Lucy Kemp-Welch and Lady Granby are
isolated examples whose work has no connection in itself and shows
very little affinity, beneath the surface, with the special influences
of their time. The strong brushwork of Mrs. Stanhope Forbes, it is
true, may be said to have arrived by way of Newlyn, but the fanciful
sentiment underlying her work has an arrival quite of its own. Miss
Lucy Kemp-Welch has made, and deserved, a place for herself the last
few years, and she stands alone among women as an animal painter of
power. Lady Granby, who is an amateur, is also an artist. Magna est
ars et prevalet. Ave!</p>

<p>Miss Mary Gow, the late Alice Havers, Miss Jessie Macgregor, Miss Anna
Alma-Tadema, Miss Lily Blatherwick, Miss Amy Sawyer, and Louisa Starr
(Madame Canziana) also make a special appeal, each in her own way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Swynnerton is a lady who has given us a great deal of work of a
very high order indeed. In the first place she has always something to
say that is worth saying. Her work is exuberant with the joy of life,
the joy of colour. Her very brush is surcharged with a high and lavish
spirit. Blue eyes look out, so blue, from happy sunburnt faces, so
sunburnt, that take their places on her canvases as in a drama to tell
us something of her thoughts and of themselves. Mrs. Swynnerton, plus
her faults, is genuine through and through. The work of another
painter, Mrs. De Morgan, naturally comes into consideration when we
turn to symbolism. More tenaciously in earnest and more austere in
every way than Mrs. Swynnerton, her work is as the poles apart. The
one romps, if the term be allowed, in a flower-spangled meadow, the
other's province is the study; and, as is the way with students, her
mind is often on the thought of the past rather than with affairs of
the present. Before one of Mrs. De Morgan's pictures one thinks
through, by way of Burne-Jones, to Botticelli and the great ancestors
of art, and it is saying a very great deal for Mrs. De Morgan that in
such case one can bless the passive hand that gives and the hand that
receives.</p>

<p>Her work may very well lead us to a small band of artists, not
definitely connected in themselves, but allied with each other in the
sense that they work for somewhat similar ends: Mrs. Marianne Stokes,
Miss Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale and Mrs. Young Hunter. To these,
perhaps, may one day be added a name very little known at present,
Miss Milicent E. Gray. It is not unusual in speaking of the work of
either of these first three artists, and more especially of Miss
Eleanor Brickdale, to refer to the pre-Raphaelite influence in art. It
is, however, extremely probable that the influence takes direct effect
in these days more as a method than as a conviction. The great
conviction itself has leavened Art, and the individualities of these
painters are so strong that it becomes in their case a nearer interest
to ignore all potters and regard the clay. Mrs. Young Hunter has a
quaint flitting fancy that wanders over hill and dale and seizes from
life subtle little touches that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> are full of the elusiveness of tales
told after school hours.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marianne Stokes is made of sterner stuff. She has worked of late
in that most stern and stubborn medium, tempera, and small things of
hers in various exhibitions attract one always with the desire to know
more of her most attractive work. Miss Eleanor Brickdale works, or
plays, always with an idea. And the idea she is not satisfied to leave
until it has taken on for other eyes a most cunning and beautiful
bodily shape, in line, in form, in colour&mdash;above all in line. She is
probably, without knowing it, as good an antithesis as may be found of
the Impressionist, so-called. The Impressionist is the incarnation of
the abstract in terms of paint, the Symbolist uses the material to
convey definite abstractions in thought. It is, by contrast with
music, the motive of symphony as compared to the motive of Oratorio or
opera, and the apposite methods may be equally well, or badly, used or
abused. Abuse may lead the militant Impressionist to an impasse of
assertive agnosticism as pedantic in its way as the lucubrations of
the most literary pedant in paint. On the other side of the lantern
you may have Watts, and the painted canvases of a Whistler. So be it.</p>

<p>Art is a long lane with many turnings, and down each there may be
found a little house with a fireside and human hearts thereby.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_IV">Women Painters in the United States of America</h2>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus041s.jpg" width="99" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">D</span>URING</b> the 19th century, in the United States of America, there came
slowly into existence a new school of painting&mdash;new often in temper
rather than in manner, for its followers usually came to Europe for
their methods. Race, climate, religion, commerce, social life,
influence art, and the painters of the United States reveal in their
work all the characteristics for which their country has long been
famous: vivacity, invention, constant enterprise, a democratic
enthusiasm, a love of truth (truth often united with romance or else
with sensationalism), and last, but not least, a rare felicity in
transforming borrowed knowledge into something quite original. It is
not often that a civilisation embodies itself in the genius of one
man, giving an epitome of all its dominant qualities; but in Mr. John
S. Sargent, R.A., we recognise a painter of tremendous gifts who does
for the United States what the manly, swaggering Rubens did for
Flanders, symbolising a people and a civilisation.</p>

<p>One sign of the democratic spirit in the progress of American Art is
to be noticed in the fact that women have participated largely in the
honours gained by the pioneers. It is noteworthy, for instance, that
the first book on Women Painters should have been written by an
American lady, Mrs Ellet, as far back as 1859. Mrs. Ellet showed great
industry, but following a custom rashly encouraged by writers on art,
she believed that she could teach painting and sculpture by the use of
words alone, in recording biographical facts, and in offering
criticisms on work that her readers could not see in illustrations.
Written history is the phonograph of all past centuries, but the
understanding of art owes little to its words.</p>

<p>Still, the enthusiasm that fired Mrs. Ellet was shared by many of her
countrywomen, and to it we owe some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> truly clever artists, like the
four sculptors, Harriet Hosmer, Florence Freeman, Edmonia Lewis and
Emma Stebbins, or like the following painters: Emily Sartain
(portraits and genre), Sara M. Peale (portraits), Mrs. J. W. Dewing
(portraits, subject pictures, flowers and still-life), Annie C. Shaw
(cattle and landscapes), Mrs. Ad&egrave;le Fassett (portraits) Mrs. Elisa
Greatorex (landscapes), Mrs. Henry A. Loop (portraits), Ella A. Moss
(portraits), Jennie Brownscombe (subject pictures), May Alcott (copies
after J. M. W. Turner and still-life), Elizabeth Boott (figure
subjects), Charlotte B. Coman (landscapes in the manner of Corot), and
that delicate recorder of pleasant secrets learnt from nature in the
fields, Fidelia Bridges. The very titles of this lady's pictures have
the fragrance of field flowers or else they glow with the plumage of
birds. It has been said of Fidelia Bridges that her art sings little
pastoral lyrics, and her art is certainly very fresh and sweet,
charmed with much sympathetic appreciation of nature in some of her
unnumbered smiling moods. For Fidelia Bridges, like Birket Foster,
paints as though the year were all springtime, a series of twelve May
months, all full of gaiety and bounty. She seldom takes heed of that
eternal warfare which accompanies Nature's bountifulness, filling the
seed-carrying winds with the presence of death, and setting every
living thing to prey upon another. To this part of Nature's life
Fidelia Bridges usually shuts her eyes, unlike Miss E. M. Carpenter,
whose landscape art reveals at times the menacing suggestion of great
rivers and of high solitary mountains.</p>

<p>It would serve no useful purpose to enumerate all the earlier women
painters of the United States. They worked bravely and well, and if
their doings are now forgotten or undervalued, it is only because the
harvest sowed by them is being reaped by the present generation.
To-day the names of at least two American women painters, Mary Cassatt
and Cecilia Beaux, are known in every country where good art is
studied. Mary Cassatt, the only pupil of Degas, is bracketed always
with Berthe Morisot, for both ladies became Impressionists at about
the same time, adding the charm of their personalities to a rugged
revolt in art.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> The work of each has great interest, but that of Mary
Cassatt is the more attractive and the more enduring. It is not
overburdened with a heavy adherence to methods originated by men; and
it is richer with the emotions of the painter's own heart. To Mary
Cassatt, Impressionism is a chosen dialect, a means by which she can
express herself in colour and form; to Berthe Morisot, on the other
hand, it was in itself the final word in painting. So, mistaking the
clay of art for the finished statue, she obeyed the methods of a
school with so much zeal and so much self-sacrifice that her own
nature became enslaved to the difficulties of technique. Compare
Berthe Morisot's able study (page <a href="#Page_211">211</a>) with the charming homeliness of
Mary Cassatt's picture (page <a href="#Page_157">157</a>), and you will see at a glance how
wide is the difference between the emotional and &aelig;sthetic value of the
subjects represented. Berthe Morisot remains a student, while Mary
Cassatt passes beyond technique to a universal delight in childhood.
She feels both the pathos and the humour of the beginnings of our
life, and she makes infancy welcome in art because she understands it
and shows no maudlin sentiment.</p>

<p>Something of the same kind is done by Miss Cornelia Conant, in her
domestic picture called "The End of the Story" (page <a href="#Page_151">151</a>); and another
view of child-life, delightfully rendered by Helen Hyde, may be seen
in colour on page <a href="#Page_145">145</a>.</p>

<p>The pictures by which Miss Cecilia Beaux is represented in this book
show very clearly that her genius has dramatic strength, sustention,
and flexibility. The portrait on page <a href="#Page_162">162</a> is handled with a sculptural
vigour that responds admirably to the character of the sitter, while
the "Mother and Child" (page <a href="#Page_121">121</a>) has a quietness of tone, a reserved
simplicity of style, a permeating suggestion of pathos, having much in
common with Whistler's portrait of his mother. Miss Cecilia Beaux is a
dramatist in her studies of character, and her art is probably more
subtle and more various than that of any woman painter who has devoted
her life to portraiture. The reader will do well to contrast her style
with that of Mrs. Anna Lea Merritt, the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> woman painter whose
work was purchased by the Chantrey Fund, London (page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>).</p>

<p>It is fitting now that a list should be given of other leading artists
of the United States, though their work is not represented here, owing
to the adventures in delays that attend a despatch of letters from
London to America.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_V">Of Women Painters in France</h2>

<p class="h3">By L&eacute;once B&eacute;n&eacute;dite.<br />Translated into English by Edgar Preston</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus114s.jpg" width="102" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">W</span>OMAN</b> in Art is a fruitful subject. It is both psychological and
&aelig;sthetic, involving as it does a question of paramount interest. At
the same time it includes a special up-to-date character, by virtue of
the grave questions arising from the position of woman in our social
system of to-day. It is, indeed, the position of woman which has for
so long a period set limits to her production of creations of the
mind, and her position has had a distinct bearing on her inspiration.</p>

<p>Thus it will be grasped, in these times of ours when the movement for
the total emancipation of woman has commenced, and when the first
franchises granted to her have already borne conclusive results, how
it is that our honoured colleague, the editor of this book, has been
led, both as an artist and as a writer on art, to conduct a sort of
historical examination enabling one to understand the position woman
has won in the realms of art in the past, and permitting one to
foresee the place she is called upon to occupy in the future.</p>

<p>With regard to the productions of the mind, it becomes necessary to
establish a well-defined distinction, at least in so far as the past,
anterior to the 19th century, is concerned, between the position of
women artists and that of literary women. The literary woman, like the
man of letters, was not subjected to any special obligation beyond the
official sanction granting her the privilege of publication&mdash;a
sanction which bore only on the question of morals and religion. Every
woman was free to write without let or hindrance, without any
preliminary education, and even without going through the formalities
of publication or the necessities of printing, since a famous woman
like Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; owed her celebrity to letters which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> not
destined to be made public. This explains the number of charming
writers among women who have added lustre to French literature by
their novels, stories, or simply by their letters, and enables one to
realise how these women authors are, in contradistinction to women
artists, persons of high standing. The chronicles of the H&ocirc;tel de
Rambouillet constitute an interesting little chapter in the history of
letters in France, just as the "Pr&eacute;cieuses Ridicules" or the "Femmes
Savantes" of Moli&egrave;re reveal to us the defects and eccentricities into
which the literary pretensions of the feminine world had fallen in the
17th century. It cannot, however, be denied that the fair sex freely
infused into the literature of that period spontaneity, life and
spirit, piquancy, affectation, and the delicate sentiments inherent to
its nature, and that it had its share of influence on French taste at
that time.</p>

<p>Altogether different is the position of their sisters, the
women-painters. Let us first look into that of the men. Painters
formerly were part of a Guild such as that of the Drapers, Bakers and
Butchers, and in their case it was a Guild which was far from
occupying the first place in the hierarchy of Guilds. The Butchers
were beyond doubt higher up in the scale than the painters. The
painters were subjected to narrow and despotic regulations; rigorous
conditions governed both apprenticeship and mastership, conditions
hardly encouraging to those who had a vocation, more especially in the
case of women, ill-protected by the weakness of their sex, by
prevalent custom, and ill-adapted for the struggle. The <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of
the Acad&eacute;mies, which followed that of the Guilds, did not bring in its
wake conditions in any degree profitable to womankind. The Acad&eacute;mie de
Saint-Luc, while pretending to safeguard the professional interests of
artists, displayed such tyrannical pretensions that a certain number
of artists rose in revolt against it, and appealed to the Royal power,
which, approached by its chief painter, Charles Le Brun, came to their
rescue, by helping them to found the celebrated Acad&eacute;mie Royale de
Peinture et de Sculpture (1666). The Acad&eacute;mie Royale proved itself
somewhat more liberal. It set no limits to the reception of those who
seemed worthy of its suffrages; we know that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> welcomed into its
bosom a number of strangers of merit, and that it opened its doors to
women. Therein lies a victory of appreciable importance, if one
considers the energy and the talent which women artists were compelled
to display, in order to conquer ancient prejudices in so signal a
fashion. Henceforth a place was assigned in art to women, a place
still hedged in with limitations, and which could be attained only by
the few privileged ones. For, in its turn, the Acad&eacute;mie served the
purpose of a few, but not that of the many. The Acad&eacute;mie reserved the
monopoly of exhibitions exclusively for its members; and artists who
did not, in one way or other, belong to this congregation, were
allowed to exhibit their works in public only once a year. It was on
the one day of the Octave of Corpus Christi, for a space of two hours,
in the open air, and within the circumference of the Place Dauphine.
All great artists had to submit to this treatment, ere they could
force the portals of the Acad&eacute;mie. But times have changed! Our
contemporaries, so inconstant, so impatient, who wear out the
attention of the public by the excessive multiplicity of their
exhibitory manifestations, should occasionally think of the conditions
under which their forerunners laboured.</p>

<p>Imagine a woman placed in the midst of these quarrels and struggles of
rival Academies, with men in strong and often fierce antagonism on all
sides of her; picture not only these general difficulties, but those
of a more particular sort which arise from the disabilities of her
sex, her subordinate state; think of the drawbacks&mdash;the prejudices,
the <i>convenances</i> to be considered, and then the embarrassing
promiscuity of life in studio and school, particularly as regards the
study from the living model&mdash;and one can realise how brave, how
energetic, or how ambitious must be the woman who would win the title
of Artist.</p>

<p>It is clear that the Royal Academy's liberal measure in opening its
doors to women of talent was an event of some importance, from the
moral point of view at any rate. It was the public recognition of
woman's capacity in matters of art, the official consecration of merit
which might come to light; also it afforded a goal to strive for&mdash;a
goal hard to reach and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> very remote, doubtless, but still a goal
possible of attainment to the most courageous and the most hopeful
among women. The real, as distinct from the moral, advantages were,
however, rather limited. From 1663, the date which marks the admission
of the first woman artist, to 1783, when the last was admitted&mdash;that
is to say during a period of eighty years&mdash;exactly fifteen women
painters were elected, and among them were three foreigners. In 1770,
indeed, on the nomination of Mlle. Giroust, wife of Roslin, the
painter, it was decided that, as there were already in the company two
other women previously elected, there must not be more than four women
in all within the Academy. This measure of restriction was renewed in
1783 and ratified by Royal ordinance on the election of Mme. Vig&eacute;e Le
Brun.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was an appreciable number of women artists in
France throughout the course of the 18th century. Their social rank
was strictly confined. There were no "women of quality," such as were
to be found in the world of letters, no representatives of the
<i>bourgeoisie</i> even. The women artists, with very rare exceptions, all
belonged to artist families. They were the wives, the daughters, the
sisters or the nieces of artists, and this tradition, as we shall see,
even continued long into the 19th century. Catherine Duchemin, the
first woman elected to the Academy, was the wife of the sculptor,
Girardon, while Genevi&egrave;ve and Madelaine Boulogne, both academicians,
were related to distinguished painters of that name. Mlle. Reboul was
Mme. Vien, and Mme. Labille des Vertus became Mme. Vincent on her
second marriage. Then we have Mlle. Natoire, sister of the director of
the Academy of France, Catherine van Loo, one of the innumerable
family of Van Loo, Mme. de Valsaureaux, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parrocel, of the no less
numerous family of Parrocel, Mme. Therbouch, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Liscewska, all this
family, father, mother, and daughters alike, being painters; and Mme.
Vig&eacute;e herself, who married the picture dealer Le Brun, was the
daughter of a portrait painter.</p>

<p>During the 17th and 18th centuries these great artist families
intermarried to such an extent as to form a series
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of veritable
dynasties&mdash;for instance, those of the Coypels, the Coustous, the Van
Loos, the Boulognes, the Parrocels, and the Vernets, to name but a few
of the most renowned. Artist families became allied just as do those
of lawyers and merchants. Thus their social life grew more limited,
each category more and more distinct and apart, for these artist
families rarely strayed beyond their own <i>milieu</i>. And those very
circumstances which tended to retard the development of the artistic
calling in woman exerted their influence over the inspiration of the
female artist. The impossibility of pursuing very far the study of
anatomical drawing, owing to the nudity of the model, diverted them
almost entirely to the studies of observation and of imitation, to
portrait work, and flowers and animals and still-life. Later, when
they obtained greater liberty, they devoted themselves to <i>genre</i> of a
size and kind demanding less substantial preparation. But as for
composition, they never touched "history," as it was termed&mdash;that is,
lofty, heroic or allegorical subjects&mdash;and if there should chance to
have been any exception to this rule, it was simply in the direction
of religious <i>motifs</i>.</p>

<p>Further, they long affected what may be called medium processes:
pastel, water-colour, miniature, all kinds of work offering
opportunity of finish and <i>&eacute;clat</i>. They showed a partiality for oil
painting after the manner of the smaller Dutch masters, who had no
more faithful imitators in all France. Mme. Vien, Mme. de Valsaureaux,
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Parrocel, and particularly Mme. Vallayer Coster&mdash;"<i>femme qui fut
un habile homme</i>," according to the verses written in her
honour&mdash;excelled in this style.</p>

<p>Some of the "<i>Acad&eacute;mistes</i>"&mdash;to use the old French expression&mdash;won
real celebrity, but few there were who achieved lasting glory. In the
reign of Louis XIV, the woman artist whose reputation shone with the
clearest lustre was Elisabeth Sophie Ch&eacute;ron, who excelled in all the
arts&mdash;for she was a clever painter, a consummate musician, a poet of
merit and <i>femme d'esprit</i> into the bargain. Following the general
rule she belonged to one of the numerous artist families. Daughter of
a painter (Louis Ch&eacute;ron), she was also sister of a painter. This
latter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> who was her junior, had talent, but not to the extent of the
elder. &Eacute;lisabeth Sophie Ch&eacute;ron was of Huguenot family, as was
frequently the case among the Academicians, although, from what absurd
prejudice I know not, the <i>r&eacute;form&eacute;s</i> were regarded as less artistic
than other folk. But in 1668,&mdash;she was twenty then&mdash;terrified no doubt
by the ever-increasing persecution of the Protestants&mdash;a persecution
which was soon to result in the Edict of Nantes&mdash;she, like her sister,
abjured her faith, whereas her brother, remaining true to the family
faith, was forced to take refuge in London, where he died.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Several Acad&eacute;miciens of the reformed religion were
excluded, or obliged to submit to the Catholic religion.</div>

<p>Sophie translated into French the Psalms of David, which her brother
illustrated admirably, and she has left at least one important
engraved work, but above all, she has left a number of portraits of
well-known people of her time, portraits that the sitters made her
copy four and even five times.</p>

<p>Among other "<i>Acad&eacute;mistes</i>," interesting if not so well known, was
that sister of the "<i>Visitandine</i>" order, Anne Marie Tr&eacute;sor, who
decorated with religious subjects the church of the monastery of the
"Dames de Ste. Marie de Chaillot." She was received by the Academy in
1676, and the choice of the Academy showed, as its accepted members
were of such different views, that the body was after all somewhat
broad in character. Another proof of this liberal spirit is to be
found in the fact that the Academy received foreign artists within its
body. There were three of them; the first was Mlle. Haverman, of Dutch
origin, who was, however, excluded shortly after her election&mdash;she
attempted to justify her election by sending in a painting which was
not her own, but the work of her master, Van Huysum. The second
foreign "<i>Acad&eacute;miste</i>" was specially illustrious and worthy of the
honour conferred on her. She was Rosalba Carriera, a Venetian, a woman
who was really original, and whose reputation has lived through the
centuries, but about whom, in this chapter devoted to France, I must
not speak at length. The last of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>three was Mme. Terbouche, or,
more exactly, Therbousch, who, although born in 1728 at Berlin, was
numbered by our old museum catalogues in the ranks of the French
School.</p>

<p>May 31st, 1783, was an exceptionally important date for the Academy,
in respect of women artists. On that day were received Mme. Vig&eacute;e Le
Brun and Mme. Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de Labille Guyard (or Guiard). One may say that at
that very hour began officially the rivalry which constantly existed
between the two women, both of real merit, throughout their careers&mdash;a
rivalry which has been maintained in the preference shown for one or
the other, after death, by their historians. Mme. Vig&eacute;e Le Brun was
the more celebrated of the two, and rightly so, for one might say that
of all the women painters of her time she had a personality quite her
own, quite feminine, rich in grace, ease, variety of attitude, gesture
and composition, discreet and delicate affectedness, freshness and
brightness. Mme. Vig&eacute;e Le Brun was the daughter of a somewhat mediocre
painter, and the wife of a well-known picture dealer, whom she married
when quite young. She had lessons from Doyen, Greuze and Joseph
Vernet, and her success was quickly achieved. Mlle. Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de Labille
des Vertus, the daughter of a mercer, was married to a certain Guyard,
a neighbour. She did not live long with him, and had lessons from an
old friend, the painter Vincent (the father), and afterwards from La
Tour. While Mme. Le Brun, whose work was admired by Marie Antoinette,
was supported by the Court, Mme. Guyard secretly made friends in the
body of the Academy itself, painting the portraits of first one member
and then another. On the day of the election, she seemed to be
overcoming her rival, whom her friends succeeded in putting on one
side because the rules of the Academy forbade the traffic in pictures.
Mme. Le Brun was received only by order of the King. Her own
autobiography, as well as the pamphlets of the time, depict for us the
powerful rivalry which existed, and also the many calumnies with which
the three women painters were attacked (there was a third candidate,
Mme. Vallayer Coster), even in their private life, the persecution of
offensive insinuations, and the existence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> of the accusation so often
levelled against women painters, that their work is not their own.
Posterity has reconciled the rivals on the walls of our galleries. If
Mme. Vig&eacute;e Le Brun certainly holds pride of place, Mme. Guyard, by her
more solid talent, perhaps more characteristic, has an enviable
position at her side.</p>

<p>By the side of these celebrated women there are a few others of whom
the recollection is not quite so keen, but who were not without a
touching grace, though they lived their life within the sphere of
their masters' influence, illuminated by the renown of these masters
and breathing their atmosphere. It would not be right to say that
these women artists copied their masters, or slavishly imitated them,
but they transposed their qualities, elevated them by feminising them.
Of these, I may mention Mlle. Ledoux, who followed in the wake of
Greuze; Mlle. Marguerite G&eacute;rard, who lived under the shadow of
Fragonard; and that exquisite and sorrowful figure, Mlle. Constance
Mayer, whose devotion for her master Prudhon found its supreme
expression in her tragic end. Less brilliant, rather hidden in the
twilight of history, these women yet exercise on our thoughts an
influence more subtle and delicate, and more penetrating.</p>

<p>The approach of the great national crisis, and even the worst days of
that period, at the same time glorious yet barbaric, did not
extinguish the zeal of the women painters. It seems rather as though
they shut themselves up in the study of their art so as to secure a
refuge for their hopes and their dreams. In the first "Salons" of the
century, one is surprised to find works by a comparatively large
number of women painters. In 1800, of 180 exhibitors they number 25;
eight years later, in the "Salon" of 1808, they are 46 out of 311. The
difficulties set up by the Academy were overcome, the liberty to
exhibit was a fresh encouragement, even an exceptional stimulus. The
figures, therefore, rise still further in the first quarter of the
century, so that in 1831 the women number 149 out of 873 exhibitors.
The "staff," so to speak, of the women artists of that day,
surrounding Mme. Vig&eacute;e Le Brun, whose glorious and somewhat
chequered career did not close till 1842, included a number of
distinguished women, such as Mlle. Bevic and Mlle. Capet, pupils of
Mme. Guyard; Mme. Chaudet, the wife of the sculptor; Mlle. Eulalie
Morin; Mme. Ad&egrave;le Romance, who also signed Romany, or Romany de
Romance; the "good" Mlle. Godefroid, pupil of Baron G&eacute;rard, who helped
him in so many of the portraits of contemporary cosmopolitan people of
distinction, commissions for which rained in the master's studio,
after the entry of the allied forces into Paris. Later on, we have
Mlle. Cogniet; Mme. Filleul; Mme. Rude, the wife of the great
sculptor, who had a severe yet confident talent. Lastly, there was the
woman artist who benefited by all the advantages of fashion, Mme.
Haudebourt-Lescot.</p>

1755-1842</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Mlle. Lescot, wife of Haudebourt, the architect, and pupil of
Lethi&egrave;re&mdash;mischievous tongues, of course, declared that he painted her
pictures&mdash;was a strange creature, who, at the start, owed the
popularity she obtained as much to her personal charm as to her real
talent. Her first success was in the drawing-room, where people
admired her dances. "She was," says a writer, "ugly and captivating,
with crooked eyes and a charming expression, her mouth ill-shaped, but
tender and inviting," such as Ingres represented her in one of his
finest pencil drawings.</p>

<p>Hitherto, women had certainly banished themselves into the domain of
portrait or still-life painting, that is to say, they had done little
that was not sheer copying. But, little by little, under the influence
of the lesser Dutch masters, who had been passionately appreciated
since the close of the previous reign, and thanks to the opening of
the Royal Collections at the Luxembourg Palace, where they could be
studied and copied, the women-painters, following the example of the
masters who gained inspiration therefrom, began to devote themselves
to landscape and to <i>genre</i>. They sought out little touching subjects,
which very frequently bordered on the ridiculous. For example, "the
child's bed catches fire through the carelessness of the nurse who has
fallen asleep, and the dog attempts to waken her."</p>

<p>Mlle. Lescot cut herself adrift from all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> insipidities. The
opportunity came for her to spend several years in Rome. She was
struck by the popular customs of the country, by its colour and that
singular and picturesque charm which Granet had been the first to
discover&mdash;the charm which, after her own time, was to be made further
known by the paintings of the well-known L&eacute;opold Robert. As a matter
of fact, she was practically the creator of the type of exotic
subjects borrowed from Italy, to which numerous artists in France
devoted themselves&mdash;H&eacute;bert, Bonnat and Jules Lefebvre, to name but a
few of the most important of them. In choosing her <i>motifs</i> she
displayed wit and inventiveness, and at times a delicate grace,
notably in her first pictures, before the desire to satisfy a daily
increasing connection had driven her into unduly hurried work. Her
technique, too, was brisk, yet careful, as it should be in small works
such as hers. Her lightly-touched lithographs, together with those
which she did "after" her own pictures, contributed to popularise her
special subjects and her name.</p>

<p>The novelty of these paintings, devoted to the cult of "local colour,"
caused them to be adopted as "romantic." It was the same with Schnetz
and L&eacute;opold Robert, who shared the popularity. But the real "Young
romantic" among artists was Mlle. de Fauveau. What one discovers with
regard to her is that she is not a painter but a sculptor. The Royal
Academy of the 17th century had already boasted certain wood carvings
by <i>la demoiselle</i> Mass&eacute;. Also, there was Mme. Falconet. But the great
and austere art was cultivated only as a rare exception by woman.
Mlle. F&eacute;licie de Fauveau was the first pre-Raphaelite, although the
return to the primitive Italian masters of the 16th century dates
further back, but with cropped head under a velvet toque, after the
style of Raphael himself, she unceasingly uttered curses against that
noble personality, whose brush produced the highest incarnation of the
art of painting.</p>

<p>But the naturalist movement it was that witnessed the development of
the greatest artistic personality in the feminine world of
to-day&mdash;Rosa Bonheur. The <i>r&ocirc;le</i> played by Rosa Bonheur is important
from the feminine point of view, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> reason that she broke away
from ancient traditions. She revealed what woman was capable of in the
matter of energy, of continuity of purpose, of method, of scientific
direction, in a word, in the indispensable impetus of inspiration.
Before her day, the woman-painter had always been looked upon rather
as a phenomenon, or her place in the domain of art was conceded to her
on the grounds that she was indulging in an elevating and tasteful
pastime, coming under the category of "accomplishments." Rosa Bonheur
gave to woman a position equal to that of man. She won for herself
unanimous admiration, based, not on the singularity of her life, not
on looseness of morals, not on social triumphs, not on friends at
Court, but on her robust, virile, observant and well-considered
talent, which in its turn was based on a primary study of anatomy and
osteology, developed by a continuous observation of the constitution
and the life of the animal world. Her long life was crowned with
glory. She held an exceptional place in art, akin to that of George
Sand in the world of letters.</p>

<p>From that day forth, there appeared a new phase in the artistic life
of woman. Art became for her, not merely an intellectual pastime, but
a vocation and a career. Rosa Bonheur lived nearly to the close of the
nineteenth century, seeing many revolutions both in French life and in
French art, but remaining always quite true to herself. Perhaps the
most uncertain period of all, historically, so far as women were
concerned, was that period of wave-like fluctuation in French art that
occurred in the seventies and eighties, reflecting itself in the work
of such women painters as Ang&egrave;le Dubos, Jeanne Fichel, Marie Petiet,
Laure de Chatillon, F&eacute;licie Schneider, Eva Gonzal&egrave;s, Marie Nicolas,
and Rosa Bonheur's successor&mdash;her heiress, so to speak&mdash;Madame
Virginie Demont-Breton, the daughter, wife and niece of a family of
distinguished artists. She has achieved a well-deserved popularity
with her subjects of popular and rustic life, and, like Rosa Bonheur,
has attained the rank of officer of the Legion of Honour. Two other
feminine personalities have attracted the attention of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> public
and artists, the one, the sister-in-law of Manet, the delightful
Mademoiselle Morisot, who has, so to speak, improved on the refinement
of her master; the other, that strange and alluring young Russian
girl, who adopted France as her Fatherland, and whom France adopted as
artist. Marie Bashkirtseff, struck down by a cruel and premature
death, at the age of twenty-three, revealed something far more than
mere happy gifts. One is surprised at the amount of studies produced
by the unfortunate and beautiful creature in the short space allotted
to her for her life-work.</p>

<p>We now enter upon the present period of woman's artistic life, the
active period, let us call it. We no longer trouble about her place at
our exhibitions, since she has nowadays her own exhibition, or rather
exhibitions proper to herself. Among the many youthful <i>amateurs</i> who
constitute the bulk of feminine artists, one finds a number of true
artists. To name a few: Mademoiselle Louise Abb&eacute;ma, Madame Madeleine
Lemaire, Madame Nanny Adam, Mlle. Fi&eacute;rard, Mme. Vallet-Bisson, Madame
Chatrousse, Madame Darmesteter, Mme. Delacroix-Garnier, Mme.
Baury-Saurel, and many others, as this book proves.</p>

<p>Several women-artists have won their place in the National Museum,
wherein first rank is held, after Rosa Bonheur and Mme. Demont-Breton,
by Madame Marie Cazin, painter and sculptor, Madame Victoria Dubourg
(widow of Fantin-Latour), Mlle. Dufau, who has just been commissioned
to execute some important decorations for the Sorbonne, Mlle.
Delasalle, Mlle. Marie Gautier, Se&ntilde;ora Eva Gonzal&egrave;s, and a couple of
semi-naturalised foreigners, Miss Mary Cassatt, an American, and Mlle.
Breslau, a Swiss&mdash;both dames of the Legion of Honour.</p>

<p>To conclude, women are proving just now not only that the domain of
art should be open to them as freely as it is to men, on the grounds
of right and reason, but also that they are specially gifted by their
delicate sensitiveness, their quickness of comprehension, their
initiative faculty, and lastly, by all the phases of their natural
temperament, and by their intelligence to endow art with the elements
of expression and beauty proper to womankind.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_VI">Women Painters in Belgium and in Holland</h2>

<p class="h3">By N. Jany.<br />
Translated by Edgar Preston</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus176s.jpg" width="102" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">A</span>S</b> far as we are able to ascertain, the history of the present subject
takes us back to the time of Hubert and Jean Van Eyck, whose sister
Marguerite made a name for herself in art. In the important volume by
M. J. du Jardin, "L'Art Flamand," there is reproduced a drawing
"after" a miniature by Marguerite Van Eyck, representing St. Catherine
and St. Agnes, but we read elsewhere that "no work can with certainty
be attributed to her."</p>

<p>Among women workers a century later, we find: Clara de Keyzer, Suzanne
Horebout and Anna Smyters, all three of Ghent. Clara de Keyzer, who
flourished about 1530, visited Germany, Italy, France and Spain.
Suzanne Horebout (1503-1545) was the daughter of Gerard Horebout, a
painter of Ghent, who betook himself to England, and became painter to
Henry VIII. D&uuml;rer knew him at Antwerp, in 1521, and there paid homage
to the skill of his daughter, who was then barely 18 years of age. She
accompanied her father to England, and was there received with the
utmost favour; she made a rich marriage with John Parcker (or Parker),
one of the King's archers, and died full of honours in her adopted
country.</p>

<p>Anne Smyters who flourished about 1540, is named in words of praise by
Van Mander, Vaernewyck and Guicciardini. She married the celebrated
sculptor, Jean de Heere, and was the mother of Luc de Heere, the
painter, who made a long stay in England, where, among other works of
importance, he did a series of decorative paintings for the Earl of
Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>Siret's "Dictionnaire" tells us that "in 1868, M. Lescart, a barrister
of Mons, was the possessor of the only known picture by Catherine van
Hemessen. This is a half-length study of the Virgin fondling the
infant Christ, with a background of landscape wherein one perceives
snow. It is painted on wood, and bears the signature: 'Caterina de
Hemessen pingebat.'" But there is in London an interesting portrait of
a man, by her, dated 1552, and an illustration of it will be found on
page <a href="#Page_263">263</a>.</p>

<p>Then comes a series of daughters (and a sister) of famous painters,
viz: Justine van Dyck; Gertrude van Veen; Catherine Pepyn; Catherine
Peeters; Anne-Marie, Fran&ccedil;oise-Catherine and Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se van
Thielen; and Laurence-Catherine Ykens. The daughter of Antony van Dyck
was born in London, in 1641. "She was wedded at the age of 12," says
Siret's "Dictionnaire," "to Sir John Stepney de Prendergast, and
abjured Protestantism at Antwerp on the 19th of August, 1660. Left a
widow, she made a second marriage with Martin de Carbonell. Van Dyck's
daughter was unfortunate, for she found herself compelled to ask the
King for a pension, which she obtained."</p>

<p>The daughter of Otto van Veen, known as Venius, the teacher of Rubens,
was born at Antwerp in 1602. She was a pupil of her father, and
married Louis Malo. The Brussels gallery contains a portrait of her
father, from her brush. She died in 1643. The daughter of Martin Pepyn
lived in Antwerp about 1619. She specialised in portrait work, and was
received into the Corporation of St. Luke, of that city, in 1650, by
virtue of being a daughter of the master.</p>

<p>The success obtained by the flower-paintings of Seghers and Breughel
suddenly caused a great development of this special branch of art, to
which, moreover, the celebrated Dutchman Jean-David de Heem, then
domiciled in Antwerp, was a notable contributor. Among the women who
became inspired by their example and followed their technique may be
mentioned: Catherine Peeters, and the three daughters, pupils of the
painter, Jean-Philippe van Thielen (himself a direct disciple of
Seghers), and Laurence-Catherine Ykens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The registers of the Antwerp Academy for 1784 contain the name of
Marie Baesten, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ommeganck. Siret's "Dictionnaire" also mentions
(at Bruges), the daughter of Louis de Deyster, the painter. Anne de
Deyster (1690-1747) attracted notice by the perfection with which she
copied her father's pictures. Gertrude de Pelichy, of Utrecht
(1743-1825), was appointed an honorary member of the Imperial and
Royal Academy of Painting in Vienna, and at Bruges she painted the
portrait of the Emperor Joseph II., and that of the Empress
Maria-Theresa.</p>

<p>At the opening of the 19th Century, the Art of the Miniature was
cultivated&mdash;as they expressed it in those days&mdash;by Marie-Josephe
Dargent of Li&egrave;ge, a daughter and pupil of Michel Dargent, the elder,
Hortense van Baerlen, and Am&eacute;lie van Assche, whose sister, Isabelle
Catherine, a pupil of her uncle, Henry van Assche, had devoted herself
to landscape painting.</p>

<p>Siret's dictionary then notices a large number of women painters both
historical and <i>genre</i>.</p>

<p>Marie-Adelaide Kindt of Brussels, who was a pupil of David and of
Navez, and visited Germany and France; Julie-Anne-Marie No&euml;l, wife of
the painter, J. B. van Eycken, of Brussels; Mme.
Isabelle-Marie-Fran&ccedil;oise Geefs, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Corr, of Brussels, a pupil of
Navez; Mme. de Keyzer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marie Isabelle Telghuis, wife of the
former director of the Antwerp Academy, Nicaise de Keyzer. As to Mme.
O'Connel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique Miethe, of Berlin, a pupil of Begas and of
Gallait, "there is (writes C. Lemonnier in his 'Histoire des Beaux
Arts en Belgique'), in her wild paintings, as it were, a reflection of
Rubens."</p>

<p>Mlle. C. de Vrient, of Ghent, sister of the painters Albert and
Julien, was a flower painter of distinction, like Mlle. Renoz, Mlle.
de Franchimont, Mlle. F. Capesius and Mlle. E. de Vigne. Marie
Ommeganck, a sister of the renowned Balthazar Ommeganck, surnamed the
"Racine des Moutons," painted several landscapes in the manner of her
brother; Mlle. Euphrosine Beernaert, of Ostend, a pupil of L. Kuhnen,
painted landscapes characteristic of Zeeland and the Campine. The
Brussels Gallery has several of her works, including <i>Les Vieux
Ch&ecirc;nes, &icirc;le de Walcheren</i>, and a <i>Lisi&egrave;re de Bois en Hollande</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Before citing the names of the professional women painters who
continue to contribute to the fame of the Belgian School, let me say a
word in admiration of the talent of sundry "amateurs" (as they are
called, to distinguish them from the others), chief among whom is
H.R.H. the Comtesse de Flandre. The small-sized portraits in oils
painted by the Duchesse d'Ursel are restrained in manner and full of
charm.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the pastel portraits by the Baroness Lambert de
Rothschild attract attention by the richness of their colouring and
their firm drawing, while those of the Comtesse Ghislaine de Caraman
impress one by their distinction and their style. Madame Philippson,
who is at present devoting herself specially to sculpture, has
exhibited oil paintings, boldly handled and decorative in effect, and
Madame Rolin-Jacquemyns has engraved in most skilful fashion several
etchings representing "The Desolate Spots of the Campine."</p>

<p>The most notable of the women-painters of the Belgian School to-day is
certainly Madame Marie Collart, who with rare skill, has chosen a path
to herself whereon she walks alone with an admirable instinct for
intimate rusticity, showing much deep feeling. The painting of Mlle.
Anna Boch, on the other hand, is bright and gay. She formed one of the
famous group of the XX., and following the example of several of its
members, she has now turned her attention to the special study of
light in the open air. Mlle. Louise H&eacute;ger, after painting the lonely
<i>dunes</i> of Flanders, and the Campine, has been studying and skilfully
representing the slaty tints of the high plateau of the Ardennes.</p>

<p>The most interesting of the "M&eacute;nages d'artistes" existing at present
in the Belgian School is that of the Wytsmans. While Rodolph Wytsman
seeks out the characteristic aspects of the landscapes of Brabant and
the silent spots among the Flemish towns, Mme. Juliette Wytsman, for
her part represents, so to speak, the floral life of the sites chosen
by her husband. She has indeed created a <i>genre</i> in which she is
without a rival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The daughters of the German engraver, Hoppe, one of whom has married
Bernier, the animal painter, and the other the landscapist, Gilsoul,
have likewise attained celebrity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The daughters and granddaughters of famous artists form yet another
section. Mlle. Alice Ronner, of Brussels, daughter of Mme. Henriette
Ronner, is beyond dispute the foremost painter of still-life in
Belgium to-day. Her technical qualities are of the highest order, her
<i>mise-en-page</i>, her draughtsmanship and her colour are in the grand
style, and her works one and all have a really masterly air. Mlle.
Marguerite Verboeckhoven, the granddaughter of the famous animal
painter, has set herself to study the delicate gradations of colour
seen on the Belgian littoral. Mlle. Verw&eacute;e, daughter of the painter of
the <i>Beau Pays de Flandre</i>, exhibits portraits, which display the
wealth of her palette; and the still-life subjects by Mlle. Georgette
Meunier, daughter of the engraver, Jean Baptiste, and niece of the
great Constantin Meunier, are delicate both in design and in
colouring. She is a pupil of Alfred Stevens.</p>

<p>Mme. Destr&eacute;e-Danse and Mlle. Louise Danse, daughters of Auguste Danse,
the engraver, have revealed themselves worthy of their father's high
gifts. Mlle. Wesmael, in some remarkable landscapes, and Mme. Marie
Durand, who has done some interesting heads, both prove that in
Auguste Danse the teacher is fully worthy of the artist.</p>

<p>With regard to Mlle. Alix d'Anethan, C. Lemonnier, in his "History of
Belgian Fine Art," writes in the following terms:&mdash;"In the Antwerp
Salon of 1882 were two canvases by Mlle. d'Anethan, <i>L'affiche</i> and
<i>L'Enfant malade</i>, which had the freshness and the limpidity of
Chardin, with a grace, a delicacy of touch, a feminine sense revealing
the teaching of that most imperious of masters, Alfred Stevens." Mlle.
Berthe Art, too, followed this prodigious master painter. She has made
her position by means of pastels which, while preserving their natural
charm, have all the solidity of oil-paintings.</p>

<p>Mlle. Marie Antoinette Marcotte at first devoted herself to the
representation of the life of the poor. Since then, however, she has
created an altogether original <i>genre</i>, which has won for her many a
success&mdash;the painting of glass-house interiors. She was "coached" by
Emile Claus, the landscapist, among whose pupils were Mme. de Weert
and Mlle. Montigny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of women painters is ever on the increase. There were as
many as thirty-nine represented at the Brussels Salon of 1848, while
at the last Brussels Salon in 1903, they were more than a hundred; and
to close this rapid survey of feminine art in Belgium, I may record a
success of another kind. In 1904, Mlle. L. Broh&eacute;e, after the various
eliminating trials, found herself among the half-dozen artists
permitted to take part in the final examination for the Prix de Rome.</p>

<p>Machteld van Lichtenberg, wife of Egbert van Boecop, is the first name
of a Dutch woman painter given in Siret's "Historical Dictionary." She
was born at Utrecht, of noble family, and made a speciality in
portrait painting. Her name is mentioned by J. van Beverwyck. Her
daughter Corn&eacute;lie also took up painting, and died at a great age in
1629.</p>

<p>Marguerite Godewyck, of Dordrecht (1627-1677), was styled a "second
Anne Schurman." She was one of the most learned women of her time, and
was further surnamed "La Perle de la Jeunesse de Dordrecht," and "La
Fleur du Paradis des Arts et des Sciences." She specialised in
portrait painting. Judith Leyster, of Haarlem, likewise enjoyed great
fame. From the year 1613 she was a member of the Guild of St. Luke,
of Haarlem. In 1635 she had a pupil, Guillaume Wauters by name, who on
leaving her entered the studio of Franz Hals. She was married at
Heemstede on the 1st of June, 1636, to the painter Jean Molenaer, also
a native of Haarlem. She is eulogistically mentioned by Th.
Schrevelius, the historian of Haarlem, who describes her as a famous
woman, justly, as he remarks, called "the true guide in the
arts"&mdash;(<i>de Ware Leyster in de Konst</i>), her name Leyster signifying
'Guide.' She died in 1660.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of the Dutch women painters of the 18th century
was Rachel Ruysch, of Haarlem. Her flowers and fruit, painted with
keen spirit and with extraordinary firmness, are extremely rich and
varied in their arrangement. She was a pupil of Guillaume Aelst. In
1695 she married Jurian Pool, and was admitted into the Hague
Corporation of Painters in 1701, the same year as her husband. Without
neglecting her duties as a mother (she had ten children) she was
constantly devoted to her art. In 1708 she was appointed Court Painter
of the Elector Palatine. Poets have sung the virtues and the gifts of
this renowned woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Agathe and Corn&eacute;lie van der Myn, sister and daughter of Herman van der
Myn, accompanied the latter when he settled in London. Notable work
was produced by three miniaturists: Henriette van Pee, wife of Herman
Wolters, was born at Amsterdam, in 1692, and became her father's
pupil. Peter the Great and the King of Prussia visited her studio,
which had a high reputation, and the customary poets wrote the
customary verses in her honour. Caroline-Petronille van Cuyck was made
an honorary member of the <i>Pictura</i> of the Hague, in 1777. Anne
Folkema, who lived between 1695 and 1768, was an active assistant of
her brother, Jacques, in his numerous works. Nor must one forget Alida
Carr&eacute;, who confined herself, for the most part, to painting fans;
Mlle. Van Kooten, whose name was inscribed in 1765 on the registers of
the Confr&eacute;rie de St. Luc, at Utrecht; Marguerite Wulfraat, of Arnhem
(1678-1738), and Elisabeth Gertrude Wassenberg, of Groningue,
(1726-1782), who painted <i>genre</i> and portraits.</p>

<p>At the opening of the 19th century the women painters of still-life,
flowers and fruit, were still in large numbers.</p>

<p>An interesting figure who has left a poetical memory is Corn&eacute;lie
Lamme, of Dordrecht, who married J. B. Scheffer, and was the mother of
the celebrated painters Henry and Ary, who belong to the French
School. After the death of her husband she settled in Paris, and there
ended her days. Her attainments, her wit, her eminent merits, made her
one of the most remarkable women of her day. She was a draughtsman and
an engraver.</p>

<p>The name of Henriette Ronner is one of great popularity. This
indefatigable artist is known as "the painter of cats," and she has
charmingly "hit off" both the heavy laziness of the mature animal, and
the frolicsomeness of the kitten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The flower pictures by Mme. van de Sande-Bakhuyzen, of the Hague, so
well known, tempted that excellent engraver, Philippe Zilcken, who has
"translated" with marvellous success their freshness and their
<i>&eacute;clat</i>. Mme. Bilders van Bosse, of the Hague, is well known by her
skilfully drawn and powerfully painted landscapes, and Mlle. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
Schwartze, of Amsterdam, a painter of high merit, has the art of
giving character to a portrait; and knows how to group her figures and
paint them in strong and sombre tones. Mme. Mesdag van Houten, of the
Hague, wife of the famous marine painter, affects the landscape at
dark, and realises fully the melancholy tenderness of the hour.</p>

<p>It may be interesting now to name a truly remarkable artist who never
exhibits&mdash;Mlle. Barbara van Houten, niece of Mme. Mesdag van Houten.
She is an excellent painter of figure pictures and still-life; her
etchings are of the highest quality, and embrace a large number of
subjects&mdash;interiors with lamp effects, children's heads, landscapes,
dead birds, bouquets of enormous sunflowers and gaudy tulips. Further,
she has interpreted in masterly fashion, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, Jules
Dupr&eacute;, Gustave Courbet and other great masters of the French School.</p>

<p>Mention must be made of Mme. Bisschop-Robertson, who paints popular
subjects with astounding vigour; Mme. Marie Heyermans, whose pictures
deal with the life and surroundings of the poor; Mlles. Anna Abrahams
and Anna Kerling, whose charming still-life pieces are coloured now in
bright, now in sombre, tones; Mme. la baronne Hogendorp S' Jacob, of
the Hague, who has turned her attention to flower painting; Mlle.
Nelly Bodenheim, who does some very clever comic scenes, for the
benefit of children; and Mlle. Wally Moes, of Amsterdam, a painter of
portraits and peasant subjects.</p>

<p>Last we come to Mlle. Marius, whose fair-tinted and most distinguished
still-life works have been seen and admired. She is an excellent art
critic, and is now publishing an important work on Dutch painting of
the 19th century.</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus195s.jpg" width="102" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">W</span>HEN</b> we look into the past history of the present subject, the first
German name we come upon is that of the Nun of Nuremberg, Sister
Margareta, who worked from 1459 to 1470, and who copied many religious
works. A century later, at Udina, in Italy, Irene von Spilimberg was
born, descending from a noble German family; and although Irene died
at the age of nineteen, she yet lived long enough to win the hearty
admiration of her great master, Titian. As a picture by Irene von
Spilimberg could not be obtained for this book, the editor has begun
the German section with Anna Maria Schurman and with Maria Sibylla
Merian. The first was a clever painter-etcher as well as the most
learned lady of her time; the second was the daughter of Matthew
Merian, and the exquisite studies she made, in water-colour, of
insects and of plants and flowers, have never been excelled in their
own line.</p>

<p>From Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717) we pass on to an admirable
mezzotint, after Morland, by Maria Prestel, who died in 1794; and then
we are brought into the heart of the 19th century by the searching
industry and skill of Anna Maria Ellenrieder, a very capable
painter-etcher, who lived between the years 1791 and 1863. Ellenrieder
looked to the past for her inspiration, going to the art of the early
Dutch masters. She has little or nothing in common with the other
German women artists of her time. How different is her ideal, for
instance, from that of the well-known painter of historical subjects,
the Baroness Hermione von Preuschen, whose dramatic and sensational
spirit appeals so strongly to the great public, as in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> canvas in
which is represented the Corpse of Irene von Spilimberg, young and
beautiful, lying in state in her Venetian gondola, draped with black
and covered with flowers. Artists do not often care for pictures of
this romantic type; and they find higher and more subtle qualities in
the quiet wisdom of Julie Wolfthorn, a Berlin painter of note, and a
follower of the modern school of psychological portraiture. Julie
Wolfthorn combines depth of feeling and refinement of taste with
keenness of penetration into the mystery of individual character. Her
portrait of a young sculptor, given in the illustration on page <a href="#Page_304">304</a>,
is a good example of the painter's methods.</p>

<p>Another Berlin artist of note is Fr&auml;ulein K&auml;the Kollwitz, whose
principal field of artistic expression has hitherto been restricted to
the burin and copper plate. She has studied etching almost entirely by
herself, and by dint of persistent courage and skill has developed her
gifts in a direction all her own. The subjects that appeal most
forcibly to her mind are taken with scarcely an exception from the
darkest and most painful sides of social life and social unrest. Take
a glance at the father, mother, and child, reproduced on page <a href="#Page_302">302</a>, and
entitled "Destitution and Despair." Are you not inclined to marvel,
almost, how a woman had the courage to depict, without flinching, the
sad truths of such bitter poverty? Can you not fancy that you hear the
moan of misery, the shrill scream of starvation, the cries of
rebellion and death, as when, on the outbreak of the strike, the bulk
of the working classes casts itself upon the streets? Such masses in
motion have been made real to us in her series of plates from the
"Peasants' War."</p>

<p>An artist of considerable versatility and intuition is Dora Hitz, of
Berlin. Born at Altdorf, near N&uuml;rnberg, she began her studies at
Munich, afterwards continuing them at intervals in Paris. In 1878 she
acted upon the invitation of Carmen Silva, the Poet-Queen of Roumania,
and executed a series of decorative panels for the royal castle of
P&eacute;t&egrave;s, at Sinaivo, the pictorial subjects of which were chosen from
the literary works of her Majesty. Four years later she settled in
Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> and there she remained till 1891. During all that time her
industry never flagged, and she was much indebted to the friendly
interest which Eug&egrave;ne Carri&egrave;re took in her work. The portrait of a
little girl which may be seen here on page <a href="#Page_303">303</a>, belongs to the modern
collection in the Berlin National Gallery.</p>

<p>Our next lady painter, though of German descent, her grandfather being
a native of Hamburg, was herself born in Sweden. Her name is Jeanna
Bauck. When she was twenty-three years of age she saw the fulfilment
of her life-long yearning to go to Germany for the purpose of studying
painting, and there, with a few short breaks, she has remained ever
since, first in Dresden and D&uuml;sseldorf, and then at Munich, where she
has now taken up her abode. She was also in Paris for a while, for the
sake of study. At first exclusively a landscapist, she afterwards
turned to portrait painting, an example of which may be found on page
300. For seven years (1897-1904) she lived in Berlin, and painted
landscapes and portraits alternately, whilst superintending a
flourishing school of art for ladies. In drawing your attention to her
landscape on page <a href="#Page_301">301</a>, I should like to add that Jeanna Bauck takes
rank among the most serious women painters of to-day.</p>

<p>There is yet another portrait painter who deserves a memory for the
sake of her refinement and sensibility. I refer to the wife of Wilhelm
Jensen, the historical novelist and poet of Schleswig-Holstein. Now,
Frau Marie Jensen (Munich), once a pupil of the late Emil Lugo,
devotes herself to her art in private. Most of her portraits, too,
give proof of this same love of retirement, originating as they do in
the family circle (see page <a href="#Page_303">303</a>).</p>

<p>The portrait of a lady, on page <a href="#Page_300">300</a>, is the work of that very gifted
portrait painter, Fr&auml;ulein Maria Davids. This capable artist has
produced some excellent likenesses; among others those of the poet
Gustav Frenssen, of Professor Weber, of Freiburg, of Fr&auml;ulein von
Sydow, a daughter of the Minister of State, and of Frau Vermehren of
L&uuml;beck. Another portrait painter of fame and much power of expression,
is Frau Vilma<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> Parlaghy, her draughtsmanship being particularly good.
Hungarian by birth, she lives and works for the most part in the
German capital. Her handling of the brush is vigorous, yet sober, her
colouring is warm and harmoniously balanced, and her insight into
character quite strikingly true and convincing. The finest and most
successful efforts, in my opinion, are the portrait of the aged
Field-marshal Count von Moltke, taken in his eighty-ninth year,
shortly before his death, and that of Windhorst, the German statesman.</p>

<p>In Austria, in the dominions of the Emperor Francis Joseph, women
painters are numerous, but those of more than average gifts are not
perhaps so plentiful as elsewhere. In the Bohemian capital of Prague,
Fr&auml;ulein Hermine Laucota has worked her way up to a position of
distinction quite on her own grounds. Leading a most retired life,
devoted chiefly to the pursuit of natural history and art, she studied
first in Prague, and then partly at Antwerp and in Munich, but since
the year 1888 she has resided altogether in her native town. It is not
in colours so much as in etching on the copper plate that she has
found her medium of artistic expression, and the subjects she has
chosen are for the most part of a symbolical character, as in the
distinguished etching on page <a href="#Page_307">307</a>.</p>

<p>To come to Vienna, a couple of names of good repute occur to me: Frau
Olga Wisinger-Florian and Frau Tina Blau-Lang, the latter a refined
landscapist (see pages <a href="#Page_306">306</a> and <a href="#Page_308">308</a>). The two views of the Prater will
speak for themselves. With their charming freshness and their genial
breadth of handling, they tell us as plain as words that "all's right
with the world" in the springtime. Every touch is so bracing that it
needs no praise. Frau Blau-Lang is an optimist beyond a doubt, and
that as much by temperament as by choice of motive.</p>

<p>And when we look beyond Austria and Germany, we find everywhere among
women the same enthusiasm for art, and the same unflagging courage in
mastering the difficulties that thwart their every effort. That their
persistence has been crowned with much success is shown in a very
remarkable manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> by this present book. How admirable, for instance,
is the work done in Finland by Maria Wiik and Helene Schjerfbeck! In
Switzerland, too, if we take a glance at the country where Anna
Wasser, at the beginning of the 18th century, achieved fame by her
paintings&mdash;there, too, we are welcomed by a particularly interesting
painter's painter, Mdlle. Louise Breslau, who, with her thorough
knowledge of modern realism, never truckles to the taste of the
general public; and there, also, we find another woman painter whose
art has been inspired on several occasions by the life of Christ: a
woman painter so much occupied with the conception of her pictures
that her technique has a tendency to lag behind the almost literary
eloquence of her design. But Mdlle. Ottilie Roederstein is
nevertheless an artist of real ability.</p>

<p>From Switzerland we must turn to Spain if we would do for ourselves
what the accompanying illustrations will do for us in the pleasantest
of pleasant ways. Take, for example, the airy, fresh, excellent
landscape, a "Scene at Comillas," painted in water-colour by the
Infante Do&ntilde;a Paz de Bourbon. Then, again, the "Carriage Race at
Naples," by Do&ntilde;a Stuart Sindici, with its splendid dash and dexterity
of composition, and the court outside a "Roman Hostelry," by Elena
Brockmann, likewise a sunny scene, simply teem with warmth and colour,
and with life and beauty. Not quite so strong and independent are the
"Fisher Boys," by Antonia de Ba&ntilde;uelos, the conception and the
execution alike being apparently inspired by that mild and noble
master of Spanish painting, Esteban Murillo. Again, in Russia, we meet
with a portrait-painter, Olga de Boznanska (page <a href="#Page_316">316</a>), whose work
unites a certain independent character of its own with the influences
of her Parisian training: qualities that marked in a much higher and
more perfect degree the pictorial appeals of that young and
marvellously spirited genius whose premature death cut short a career
of infinite promise: Marie Bashkirtseff, the friend of Bastien Lepage,
and a realist full of subtlety and of penetration.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_VIII">Some Finnish Women Painters</h2>

<p class="h3">By Helena Westermarck, Critic and Painter</p>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/illus196s.jpg" width="102" height="100" alt="" />
<b><span class="hide">A</span>RT</b> in Finland, pictorial art, like much else in that country, is a
young growth. It is in the nineteenth century that we are first able
to verify its existence, and it is only in the year 1840, or
thereabouts, that we find any traces of women who seriously devoted
themselves to the study of painting. The pioneers in this may be said
to be Mathilda Rotkirch and Victoria Abey.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, in or about 1870, Fanny Churberg, after working in
D&uuml;sseldorf and Paris, evinced much independent and original talent in
landscape painting, her art having also an inaugural character, in
that she was the first who applied herself to the decoration of
textile fabrics, adapting to her purpose the old national Finnish
patterns, a practice which has since then had a large following in the
field of applied design. Her career, unfortunately, was soon ended by
illness and an early death. After her came the generation of women
artists who are at present carrying forward a young school of
enthusiastic workers.</p>

<p>In the sphere of painting, the women artists of Finland study under
much the same circumstances as their male comrades. The Schools of Art
subsidized by the State are open both to male and to female pupils,
and this applies also to all prizes and rewards of merit. Some account
of the principal women painters may be of interest.</p>

<p>Maria Wiik (1853), after an apprenticeship in the Finnish Schools of
Art and in Professor Becker's Private Academy, spent several years of
study in Paris&mdash;occasionally moving her easel in the summers to
Brittany, to Normandy, or even to St. Ives, in England. She has
further developed her art in later years by visits to Holland and to
Italy. Her talent lies in the direction of portrait and genre painting
and she has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> now the name of being among the best Finnish portrait
painters. She has executed many public commissions, such as the
portrait of the Professor at the Rein University in Helsingfors, for
the Finnish Literary Society, and that of the poet, Z. Topelius, for a
large public school for girls. Many will remember her portrait of the
School Inspector, Ohberg, which now hangs in the Helsingfors Board
School. Maria Wiik has exhibited at the Paris Salons, and at picture
exhibitions in Moscow, Copenhagen, and Dresden, and besides the prizes
awarded her in her own country, she has received a bronze medal in
Paris (1900) for a picture painted in St. Ives, called, "Out into the
World."</p>

<p>Helene Schjerfbeck (1863), also a pupil of the Finnish Schools of Art
and of Prof. Becker's Private Academy, continued her studies in Paris
and afterwards visited Brittany, England, Austria and Italy. She has
painted some important historical pictures, taking her subjects from
Finnish and Swedish history, as in her two admirable paintings,
"Liuk&ouml;ping's Prison in 1600" and "The Death of W. v. Schwerin." She
has also painted a few landscapes and a number of genre pictures, many
of them with subjects taken from French and English life. Helene
Schjerfbeck has exhibited both at home and at the Paris Salons, has
twice been awarded the lesser money prize given yearly by the Finnish
State (for the two historical pictures mentioned above), while at the
Exhibition in Paris in 1889, she received a bronze medal. She has also
held an appointment as teacher in the Finnish Academy of Art, in the
department of painting and in the drawing class from the living model.
Her many pictures have been among the best that our women artists have
produced.</p>

<p>Venny Soldan-Brofeldt (1860) is another pupil of the Finnish Schools
of Art and of Prof. Becker's Academy, and has studied later in Paris,
and in Spain and Italy. Her best work is in the genre style, many of
her pictures being very characteristic and true scenes of Finnish
peasant life, such as "Meal time in a Peasant's Hut" and "Pietists."
Her landscapes, too, are remarkable for a sensitive conception of
Nature; especially is this true of her pictures of our coast scenery,
with its low granite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> rocks, washed over by the sea waves. Mrs.
Soldan-Brofeldt has illustrated also some books for children, among
others a part of a large Scandinavian edition of Topelius' Saga tales
for children. At the Paris Exhibition of 1889, she received a "Mention
Honorable," and in 1900, a bronze medal. She is the wife of the
author, Juhani Aho. Brofeldt. Mrs. Soldan-Brofeldt's work is not
illustrated in this book, as a photograph of her most important
picture was broken into fragments in its journey from Finland to
London.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of all these painters that their artistic bias
was determined by their study in Paris of the French naturalists, who
inspired them with a stern respect for drawing, and taught them to
study Nature seriously. Starting from this common standpoint, they
have, whilst working in their own way, developed along their own
individual lines.</p>

<p>Many another woman artist deserves mention, but the limited space at
my disposal permits me to give only a list of their names.</p>

<p>There is Ellen Thesleff, a figure painter; there is Elin
Danielson-Gambogi (wife of the Italian painter, R. Gambogi),
well-known for her portraits and landscapes; there is Julia Stigzelius
de Cock (wife of the Belgian artist, C&eacute;sare de Cock), a clever
landscape painter; there is Am&eacute;lie Lundahl, figure painter; and Ada
Thil&eacute;n, with her landscapes; and Hanna R&ouml;nnberg, with her subject
pictures and outdoor scenes; and Anna Sahlst&eacute;n, a figure painter; and
last, but not least, I name Annie Torselles-Schybergson, a good
painter of animals.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
